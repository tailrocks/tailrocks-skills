# Shared writing guide

This file gives the shared writing rules.
It lists the 15 strict ASD-STE100 Issue 9 rules.
It gives term meanings and software verb meanings.
Obey this file in skills, references, README files, and documentation.

## The 15 strict rules

Read the asd-ste100 skill and its strict reference material first.
Use official Issue 9 for writing rules and general word meanings.
Compare the relevant local dictionary entries with that source.
If the entries disagree, use official Issue 9.
Use the technical-term rules for necessary software terms.

For skills, authored references, README files, and authored
documentation, obey these rules:

1. Use active voice.
2. Use simple verb forms.
3. Write instructions in the imperative form.
4. Put one instruction in each sentence.
5. Use a maximum of 20 words in an instruction sentence.
6. Use a maximum of 25 words in a descriptive sentence.
7. Put a condition before its action.
8. Use complete grammar and necessary articles.
9. Use one term for one meaning.
10. Keep noun groups short.
11. Keep one topic in each paragraph.
12. Use a maximum of six sentences in a descriptive paragraph.
13. Do not use contractions.
14. Do not use semicolons in prose.
15. If exact source text is not necessary, use American English.

Use the standard counting conventions.
Do not use artificial hyphens or fragments to meet a length limit.
Do not change the meaning to shorten a sentence.

## Check and test vocabulary

Use `check` and `test` as nouns.
For the applicable action, use `Examine`, `Make sure that`, `Do the
checks`, or `Do the tests`.
Use `Obey the rules` when the meaning is compliance.
Do not use `follow` with that meaning.

## Term consistency

Use one term for one meaning.
When an approved general word gives the correct meaning, use that
word.
Do not use a glossary to make unnecessary jargon acceptable.

## Software verbs

Use software verbs only with their stated technical meaning.

- `push`: Send Git commits to a remote repository.
- `parse`: Interpret data through a parser.
- `render`: Output that software generates from source data.
- `clone`: Make a local Git copy of a repository.
- `fetch`: Get Git objects and remote references without changes to
  working files.
- `generate`: Make output files from source files through a program.
- `install`: Add a skill or plugin through the agent's installation
  method.
- `load`: Read data or instructions into an application.
- `merge`: Combine Git changes. A skill merger combines skill
  responsibilities.
- `pin`: Select one fixed dependency version or source revision.

## Language verification

Use source review and editorial review for language verification.
A sentence-length check cannot prove complete ASD-STE100 conformity.
Do not record a word-list scan as a complete language review.

Keep obligations, recommendations, capability, possibility, and
uncertainty.
Keep conditions and the scope of negative instructions.
Keep numbers, API names, commands, paths, and configuration keys.
Keep literal code and required syntax correct.
Do not rewrite license texts or official quotations as project prose.
Identify verbatim examples that intentionally show an incorrect form.
